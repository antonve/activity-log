# activity-log

Quick and dirty implementation of an activity log based on [Don't Do Invisible Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM) by Chris Albon.

This is meant to be used for a single user in a trusted environment. This project doesn't provide authentication and is the bare minimum to implement this workflow.
